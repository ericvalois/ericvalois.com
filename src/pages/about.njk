		<p>My name is Eric. I'm a frontend developer from Montreal. If you met you at the corner of the street and you ask me to describe myself, I would say something like that:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>That I like coding semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and learning new web-related stuff. Yes, I'm a geek 🤓</li>
			<li>That I like to skate once in a while 🛹</li>
			<li>That I have two beautiful daughters ❤️</li>
			<li>I'm doing calisthenics training mostly every morning 💪</li>
			<li>My cat is called Merlin. Yes, like the wizard 🧙‍♂️</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Professional bio</h2>
		<p>I said that I am a frontend developer, but concretely, I'm working on both ends. I like the way Chris Coyier describes our job in <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/when-frontend-means-full-stack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When frontend means full stack</a> article.</p>
		<p>The line between front and back has become more and more blurry in the last decade.</p>
		<p>I can work on a new landing page with new custom CSS animations a day. The day after that, building a PHP connector to push leads to a CRM. And later adding a new feature to the React-based backend editor for the content team. 😅</p>
		<p>🚧 work in progress...</p>
