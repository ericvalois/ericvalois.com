		<p>My name is Eric, I'm a frontend developper from Montreal. If you met you at the corner of the street and you ask me to describe myself, I would say something like that:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>That I like coding sementic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and learning new web related stuff. Yes, I'm a geek 🤓</li>
			<li>That I like to skate once in a while 🛹</li>
			<li>That I have two bieautiful doughters ❤️</li>
			<li>I'm doing calisthenics trainning mostly every morning 💪</li>
			<li>My cat is called Merlin. Yes, like the wizard 🐈️</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Professionnal bio</h2>
		<p>I said that I am frontend developper but concretely, I'm working on both-ends. I like the way Chris Coyier decribe our job in <a href="https://increment.com/frontend/when-frontend-means-full-stack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When frontend means full stack</a> article.
		<p>The line between front and back has become more and more blurry in the last decade.</p>
		<p>I can work on a new landing page with new custom CSS animations a day. The day after that building a PHP connector to push leads to a CRM. And later adding a new feature to the React based backend editor for the content team. 😅</p>
